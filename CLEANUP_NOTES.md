# Folder Cleanup Notes

## Essential Files (Keep These)

### Core Code Files:
- `workflow.py` - Main workflow script (auto-discovers clusters)
- `complete_pipeline.py` - End-to-end pipeline for testing
- `data_preparation.py` - Data loading and organization
- `feature_extraction.py` - Feature extraction from galaxies
- `galaxy_detection.py` - Galaxy detection methods
- `train_classifier.py` - Model training

### Configuration:
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Documentation

### Data & Models:
- `data/` - Your training data (keep!)
- `models/` - Trained models (keep!)

## Generated Files (Can Be Regenerated)

These can be deleted and will be recreated when you run the workflow:
- `features.csv` - Feature data (regenerated by workflow)
- `processed_data/` - Processed images (regenerated by workflow)
- `results/` - Test results (regenerated when testing)

## Removed Files

The following test files were removed:
- `test_*.py` - Test scripts (no longer needed)
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache (auto-generated)

## To Regenerate

1. **Features**: Run `python workflow.py` - creates `features.csv`
2. **Processed data**: Run `python workflow.py` - creates `processed_data/`
3. **Results**: Run tests - creates `results/`
